    "\n",
    "More realisticly, images can have more discrete categories. In this task, we will try to use Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to generate images. VQ-VAE is a variant of VAE that uses a discrete latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the backbone of VAE, VQ-VAE introduces a codebook $𝐶$ to quantize the latent space. Specifically, instead of directly encoding a continuous latent variable $z$, VQ-VAE enforces that the latent representations are drawn from a finite set of discrete codes in the codebook $C$. During encoding, each latent vector is replaced by its nearest neighbor in the codebook, introducing quantization to the latent space. This process allows the model to learn a discrete, compact representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Implementation tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Codebook**: Use nn.Embedding to implement the codebook. The weights should be initialized with a uniform distribution.\n",
    "2. **Quantization**: Given the continuous latent representation $z_e$, compute distances $d^2 = z^2 + e^2 - 2 e * z$. Then, find the index of the nearest neighbor in the codebook. Use tensor.detach() to prevent gradients from flowing through the codebook."
